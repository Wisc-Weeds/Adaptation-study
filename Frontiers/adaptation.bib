  abstract = {Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) is an annual plant native to the desert Southwest of the United States and Mexico and has become invasive and caused large economic losses across much of the United States. In order to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of past invasion, and to predict future invasion, we developed a broad array of species distribution models (SDMs). In particular, we constructed sequential SDMs throughout the invasion history and asked how well those predicted future invasion (1970 to present). We showed that invasion occurred from a restricted set of environments in the native range to a diverse set in the invaded range. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that rapid range expansion was facilitated by stochastic, long-distance dispersal events. Regardless of SDM approach, all SDMs built using datasets from early in the invasion (1970–2010) performed poorly and failed to predict most of the current invaded range. Together, these results suggest that climate is unlikely to have influenced early stages of range expansion. SDMs that incorporated data from the most recent sampling (2011–2017) performed considerably better, predicted high suitability in regions that have recently become invaded, and identified mean annual temperature as a key factor limiting northward range expansion. Under future climates, models predicted both further northward range expansion and significantly increased suitability across large portions of the U.S. Overall, our results indicate significant challenges for SDMs of invasive species far from climate equilibrium. However, our models based on recent data make more robust predictions for northward range expansion of A. palmeri with climate change.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth is the most problematic weed in agronomic crop production fields in the United States. A Palmer amaranth biotype was not controlled with sequential applications of glyphosate in glyphosate-resistant (GR) soybean production field in south-central Nebraska. The seeds of the putative GR Palmer amaranth biotype were collected in the fall of 2015. The objectives of this study were to (1) confirm GR Palmer amaranth and determine the level of resistance in a whole-plant dose-response bioassay, (2) determine the copy number of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSPS) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, and (3) evaluate the response of GR Palmer amaranth biotype to POST corn and soybean herbicides with different modes-of-action. Based on the effective dose required to control 90\% of plants (ED90), the putative GR Palmer amaranth biotype was 37- to 40-fold resistant to glyphosate depending on the glyphosate-susceptible (GS) used as a baseline population. EPSPS gene amplification was present in the GR Palmer amaranth biotype with up to 32 to 105 EPSPS copies compared to the known GS biotypes. Response of GR Palmer amaranth to POST corn and soybean herbicides suggest reduced sensitivity to atrazine, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)- (mesotrione, tembotrione, and topramezone), acetolactate synthase (ALS)- (halosulfuron-methyl), and protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO)- (carfentrazone and lactofen) inhibitors. GR Palmer amaranth was effectively controlled ({$>$}90\%) with glufosinate applied at 593 g ai ha−1 with ≥95\% reduction in biomass. More research is needed to determine whether this biotype exhibits multiple resistant to other group of herbicides and evaluate herbicide programs for effective management in corn and soybean.          ,                              Amaranthus palmeri es la malezas más problemática en campos de producción de cultivos agronómicos en los Estados Unidos. Un biotipo de A. palmeri no fue controlado con aplicaciones secuenciales de glyphosate en un campo de producción de soja resistente a glyphosate (GR) en el sur central de Nebraska. Las semillas del biotipo putativo GR de A. palmeri fueron colectadas en el otoño de 2015. Los objetivos de este estudio fueron (1) confirmar que A. palmeri es GR y determinar el nivel de resistencia en un bioensayo de respuesta a dosis con plantas completas, (2) determinar el número de copias del gen 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), el objetivo molecular de glyphosate, y (3) evaluar la respuesta del biotipo GR de A. palmeri a herbicidas POST para maíz y soja con diferentes modos de acción. Con base en la dosis efectiva requerida para controlar 90\% de las plantas (ED90), el biotipo putativo GR de A. palmeri fue 37 a 40 veces más resistente a glyphosate dependiendo de la población susceptible a glyphosate (GS) base utilizada. La amplificación del gen EPSPS estuvo presente en el biotipo GR de A. palmeri con 32 y hasta 105 copias más de EPSPS comparado con biotipos GS conocidos. La respuesta de A. palmeri GR a herbicidas POST para maíz y soja sugiere una sensibilidad reducida a atrazine, y a inhibidores de hydroxy phenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) (mesotrione, tembotrione, y topramezone), de acetolactate synthase (ALS) (halosulfuron-methyl), y de protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) (carfentrazone y lactofen). A. palmeri GR fue efectivamente controlado ({$>$}90\%) con glufosinate aplicado a 593 g ai ha−1 con ≥95\% de reducción en la biomasa. Se necesita más investigación para determinar si este biotipo exhibe resistencia múltiple a herbicidas de otros grupos y para evaluar programas de herbicidas para su manejo efectivo en maíz y soja.},

  abstract = {Experiments were conducted on Palmer amaranth seeds collected in 2004 and 2006 from a natural population near Pendleton, SC, to determine the temperature and light requirements for germination of seeds retrieved from soil surface or from 10-cm depth in the field. A cyclic change in seed germination of Palmer amaranth in response to temperature and light occurred during a 12-mo after-ripening period. Freshly matured seeds collected in November required mean temperatures ≥ 25 C, and natural or red (R) light for increased germination. Following after-ripening in winter, seeds experienced a reduction in dormancy and germinated higher at 25 to 35 C mean compared with 10 to 15 C mean. With after-ripening for an additional 3 mo in May, seeds experienced a broadening of thermal range (10 to 40 C mean), and germination in natural light or R light was more than twice the germination in the absence of light. Fluctuating temperatures (7.5 C amplitude) improved germination over constant temperatures, except in summer and fall (9 and 12 mo after seed maturation). Exposure of seeds to high temperatures during summer caused secondary dormancy induction. Averaged over thermal amplitudes, seeds retrieved in fall required mean temperatures {$>$} 25 C for increased germination. Burial in spring for 3 to 6 mo induced seed dormancy, and the relative germination in fall (12 mo after seed maturation) was at least 50\% higher for seeds retrieved from soil surface compared to seeds exhumed from 10-cm soil depth. Seeds retrieved in late summer and fall required natural light or R light for promoting germination, whereas far-red (FR) light or darkness inhibited germination. Furthermore, the effect of R and FR light was reversible, indicating a partially phytochrome-mediated germination response of Palmer amaranth seeds following 9 to 12 mo of after-ripening in the field.},

  abstract = {Failure to control Palmer amaranth with glyphosate and protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO)-inhibitor herbicides was reported across southwestern Nebraska in 2017. The objectives of this study were to 1) confirm and 2) validate glyphosate and PPO-inhibitor (fomesafen and lactofen) resistance in 51 Palmer amaranth accessions from southwestern Nebraska using genotypic and whole-plant phenotypic assay correlations and cluster analysis, and 3) determine which agronomic practices might be influencing glyphosate resistance in Palmer amaranth accessions in that location. Based on genotypic assay, 88\% of 51 accessions contained at least one individual with amplification ({$>$}2 copies) of the 5-enolypyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene, which confers glyphosate resistance; and/or a mutation in the PPX2 gene, either ΔG210 or R128G, which endows PPO-inhibitor resistance in Palmer amaranth. Cluster analysis and high correlation (0.83) between genotypic and phenotypic assays demonstrated that EPSPS gene amplification is the main glyphosate resistance mechanism in Palmer amaranth accessions from southwestern Nebraska. In contrast, there was poor association between genotypic and phenotypic responses for PPO-inhibitor resistance, which was attributed to segregation for PPO-inhibitor resistance within these accessions and/or the methodology that was adopted herein. Genotypic assays can expedite the process of confirming known glyphosate and PPO-inhibitor resistance mechanisms in Palmer amaranth from southwestern Nebraska and other locations. Phenotypic assays are also a robust method for confirming glyphosate resistance but not necessarily PPO-inhibitor resistance in Palmer amaranth. Moreover, random forest analysis of glyphosate resistance in Palmer amaranth indicated that EPSPS gene amplification, county, and current and previous crops are the main factors influencing glyphosate resistance within that geographic area. Most glyphosate-susceptible Palmer amaranth accessions were found in a few counties in areas with high crop diversity. Results presented here confirm the spread of glyphosate resistance and PPO-inhibitor resistance in Palmer amaranth accessions from southwestern Nebraska and demonstrate that less diverse cropping systems are an important driver of herbicide resistance evolution in Palmer amaranth.},

  abstract = {Potential effectiveness of harvest weed seed control (HWSC) systems depends upon seed shatter of the target weed species at crop maturity, enabling its collection and processing at crop harvest. However, seed retention likely is influenced by agroecological and environmental factors. In 2016 and 2017, we assessed seed-shatter phenology in 13 economically important broadleaf weed species in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] from crop physiological maturity to 4 wk after physiological maturity at multiple sites spread across 14 states in the southern, northern, and mid-Atlantic United States. Greater proportions of seeds were retained by weeds in southern latitudes and shatter rate increased at northern latitudes. Amaranthus spp. seed shatter was low (0\% to 2\%), whereas shatter varied widely in common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) (2\% to 90\%) over the weeks following soybean physiological maturity. Overall, the broadleaf species studied shattered less than 10\% of their seeds by soybean harvest. Our results suggest that some of the broadleaf species with greater seed retention rates in the weeks following soybean physiological maturity may be good candidates for HWSC.},
