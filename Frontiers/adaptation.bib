  abstract = {Herbicide-resistant Palmer amaranth is a widespread issue in row-crop production in the Midsouthern US. Palmer amaranth is commonly found on roadside habitats in this region, but little is known on the degree of herbicide resistance in these populations. Herbicide resistance in roadside Palmer amaranth populations can represent the spread of an adaptive trait across a selective landscape. A large-scale survey was carried out in the Mississippi Delta region of eastern Arkansas to document the level of resistance in roadside Palmer amaranth populations to pyrithiobac and glyphosate, two important herbicides with broad history of use in the region. A total of 215 Palmer amaranth populations collected across 500 random survey sites were used in the evaluations. About 89 and 73\% of the surveyed populations showed {$>$}90\% survival to pyrithiobac and glyphosate, respectively. Further, only 3\% of the populations were completely susceptible to glyphosate, while none of the populations was completely controlled by pyrithiobac. Among the 215 populations evaluated, 209 populations showed multiple resistance to both pyrithiobac and glyphosate at varying degrees. Dose-response assays confirmed the presence of high levels of herbicide resistance in the five selected populations (≥ 25-fold compared to a susceptible standard). Results demonstrate the prevalence of multiple-herbicide resistance in roadside Palmer amaranth populations in this region. Growers should be vigilant of Palmer amaranth infestation in roadsides adjacent to their fields and implement appropriate control measures to prevent likely spread of herbicide resistance into their fields.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth is a troublesome weed in cotton production. Yield losses of                         65\% have been reported from season-long Palmer amaranth competition with                         cotton. To determine whether water is a factor in this system, experiments                         were conduced in 2011, 2012, and 2013 in Citra, FL, and in Tifton, GA. In                         2011, infrequent rainfall lead to drought stress. The presence of Palmer                         amaranth resulted in decreased soil relative water content up to 1 m in                         depth. Cotton stomatal conductance (g                         s) was reduced up to 1.8 m from a Palmer amaranth plant. In 2012                         and 2013 higher than average rainfall resulted in excess water throughout                         the growing season. In this situation, no differences were found in soil                         relative water content or cotton g                         s as a function of proximity to Palmer amaranth. A positive                         linear trend was found in cotton photosynthesis and yield; each parameter                         increased as distance from Palmer amaranth increased. Even in these                         well-watered conditions, daily water use of Palmer amaranth was considerably                         higher than that of cotton, at 1.2 and 0.49 g H20 cm−2                            d−1, respectively. Although Palmer amaranth removed more water                         from the soil profile, rainfall was adequate to replenish the profile in 2                         of the 3 yr of this study. However, yield loss due to Palmer amaranth was                         still observed despite no change in g                         s, indicating other factors, such as competition for light or                         response to neighboring plants during development, are driving yield                         loss.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) is an annual plant native to the desert Southwest of the United States and Mexico and has become invasive and caused large economic losses across much of the United States. In order to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of past invasion, and to predict future invasion, we developed a broad array of species distribution models (SDMs). In particular, we constructed sequential SDMs throughout the invasion history and asked how well those predicted future invasion (1970 to present). We showed that invasion occurred from a restricted set of environments in the native range to a diverse set in the invaded range. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that rapid range expansion was facilitated by stochastic, long-distance dispersal events. Regardless of SDM approach, all SDMs built using datasets from early in the invasion (1970–2010) performed poorly and failed to predict most of the current invaded range. Together, these results suggest that climate is unlikely to have influenced early stages of range expansion. SDMs that incorporated data from the most recent sampling (2011–2017) performed considerably better, predicted high suitability in regions that have recently become invaded, and identified mean annual temperature as a key factor limiting northward range expansion. Under future climates, models predicted both further northward range expansion and significantly increased suitability across large portions of the U.S. Overall, our results indicate significant challenges for SDMs of invasive species far from climate equilibrium. However, our models based on recent data make more robust predictions for northward range expansion of A. palmeri with climate change.},

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth is the most problematic weed in agronomic crop production fields in the United States. A Palmer amaranth biotype was not controlled with sequential applications of glyphosate in glyphosate-resistant (GR) soybean production field in south-central Nebraska. The seeds of the putative GR Palmer amaranth biotype were collected in the fall of 2015. The objectives of this study were to (1) confirm GR Palmer amaranth and determine the level of resistance in a whole-plant dose-response bioassay, (2) determine the copy number of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSPS) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, and (3) evaluate the response of GR Palmer amaranth biotype to POST corn and soybean herbicides with different modes-of-action. Based on the effective dose required to control 90\% of plants (ED90), the putative GR Palmer amaranth biotype was 37- to 40-fold resistant to glyphosate depending on the glyphosate-susceptible (GS) used as a baseline population. EPSPS gene amplification was present in the GR Palmer amaranth biotype with up to 32 to 105 EPSPS copies compared to the known GS biotypes. Response of GR Palmer amaranth to POST corn and soybean herbicides suggest reduced sensitivity to atrazine, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)- (mesotrione, tembotrione, and topramezone), acetolactate synthase (ALS)- (halosulfuron-methyl), and protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO)- (carfentrazone and lactofen) inhibitors. GR Palmer amaranth was effectively controlled ({$>$}90\%) with glufosinate applied at 593 g ai ha−1 with ≥95\% reduction in biomass. More research is needed to determine whether this biotype exhibits multiple resistant to other group of herbicides and evaluate herbicide programs for effective management in corn and soybean.          ,                              Amaranthus palmeri es la malezas más problemática en campos de producción de cultivos agronómicos en los Estados Unidos. Un biotipo de A. palmeri no fue controlado con aplicaciones secuenciales de glyphosate en un campo de producción de soja resistente a glyphosate (GR) en el sur central de Nebraska. Las semillas del biotipo putativo GR de A. palmeri fueron colectadas en el otoño de 2015. Los objetivos de este estudio fueron (1) confirmar que A. palmeri es GR y determinar el nivel de resistencia en un bioensayo de respuesta a dosis con plantas completas, (2) determinar el número de copias del gen 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), el objetivo molecular de glyphosate, y (3) evaluar la respuesta del biotipo GR de A. palmeri a herbicidas POST para maíz y soja con diferentes modos de acción. Con base en la dosis efectiva requerida para controlar 90\% de las plantas (ED90), el biotipo putativo GR de A. palmeri fue 37 a 40 veces más resistente a glyphosate dependiendo de la población susceptible a glyphosate (GS) base utilizada. La amplificación del gen EPSPS estuvo presente en el biotipo GR de A. palmeri con 32 y hasta 105 copias más de EPSPS comparado con biotipos GS conocidos. La respuesta de A. palmeri GR a herbicidas POST para maíz y soja sugiere una sensibilidad reducida a atrazine, y a inhibidores de hydroxy phenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) (mesotrione, tembotrione, y topramezone), de acetolactate synthase (ALS) (halosulfuron-methyl), y de protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) (carfentrazone y lactofen). A. palmeri GR fue efectivamente controlado ({$>$}90\%) con glufosinate aplicado a 593 g ai ha−1 con ≥95\% de reducción en la biomasa. Se necesita más investigación para determinar si este biotipo exhibe resistencia múltiple a herbicidas de otros grupos y para evaluar programas de herbicidas para su manejo efectivo en maíz y soja.},

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of degree of water stress on the growth and fecundity of A. palmeri using soil moisture sensors under greenhouse conditions. Two A. palmeri biotypes collected from Nebraska were grown in loam soil maintained at 100\%, 75\%, 50\%, 25\%, and 12.5\% soil field capacity (FC) corresponding to no, light, moderate, high, and severe water stress levels, respectively. Water was regularly added to pots based on soil moisture levels detected by Watermark or Decagon 5TM sensors to maintain the desired water stress level. Amaranthus palmeri plants maintained at ≤25\% FC did not survive more than 35 d after transplanting. Amaranthus palmeri at 100\%, 75\%, and 50\% FC produced similar numbers of leaves (588 to 670 plant−1) based on model estimates; however, plants at 100\% FC achieved a maximum height of 178 cm compared with 124 and 88 cm at 75\% and 50\% FC, respectively. The growth index (1.1×105 to 1.4×105 cm3 plant−1) and total leaf area (571 to 693 cm2 plant−1) were also similar at 100\%, 75\%, and 50\% FC. Amaranthus palmeri produced similar root biomass (2.3 to 3 g plant−1) at 100\%, 75\%, and 50\% FC compared with 0.6 to 0.7 g plant−1 at 25\% and 12.5\% FC, respectively. Seed production was greatest (42,000 seeds plant−1) at 100\% FC compared with 75\% and 50\% FC (14,000 to 19,000 seeds plant−1); however, the cumulative seed germination was similar (38\% to 46\%) when mother plants were exposed to ≥50\% FC. The results of this study show that A. palmeri can survive ≥50\% FC continuous water stress conditions and can produce a significant number of seeds with no effect of on seed germination.},

Appropriate tactics for managing this weed proactively in the Upper Midwest will depend on characterizing its damage niche, the geographic range in which it can reduce crop yields. We implemented a common garden study in 2011 and 2012, planting eight accessions of Palmer amaranth from the southern and midwestern United States, into soybean crops in southern, central, and northern Illinois, at a population density of 8 plants m−2 with a biocontainment protocol. Once Palmer amaranth plants initiated flowering, they were removed and burned. Weed survival, flowering, and weed biomass were measured, in addition to soybean yield and weather data. Analyses indicated that Palmer amaranth's damage niche in Illinois soybean was independent of weed genotype or maternal environment. Despite competing only briefly, Palmer amaranth reduced soybean yields in all site–years, indicating its damage niche in Illinois, and much of the Midwest, is limited primarily by seed immigration rate. These results highlight the urgent need for weed managers to learn Palmer amaranth identification, prevent seed introduction, and maintain a policy of zero seed return.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Migratory waterfowl have often been implicated in the movement of troublesome agronomic and wetland weed species. However, minimal research has been conducted to investigate the dispersal of agronomically important weed species by waterfowl. The two objectives for this project were to determine what weed species are being consumed by ducks and snow geese, and to determine the recovery rate and viability of 13 agronomic weed species after passage through a duck's digestive system. RESULTS Seed recovered from digestive tracts of 526 ducks and geese harvested during a 2-year field study had 35 020 plants emerge. A greater variety of plant species emerged from ducks each year (47 and 31 species) compared to geese (11 and 3 species). Viable seed from 11 of 13 weed species fed to ducks in a controlled feeding study were recovered. Viability rate and gut retention times indicated potential dispersal up to 2900 km from the source depending on seed characteristics and variability in waterfowl dispersal distances. CONCLUSIONS Study results confirm that waterfowl are consuming seeds from a variety of agronomically important weed species, including Palmer amaranth, which can remain viable after passage through digestive tracts and have potential to be dispersed over long distances by waterfowl. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

Between 137 and 161 Palmer amaranth populations were evaluated for sensitivity to the labelled field rate (1X), and rated as resistant (≤49\% injury), less sensitive (50\% to 89\% injury), or susceptible (90\% to 100\% injury). For glyphosate, 62\%, 19\%, 13\%, and 13\% of the populations from the High Plains, Central Texas, Rio Grande Valley, and Lower Gulf Coast, respectively, were resistant. Resistance to atrazine was more common in Palmer amaranth populations from the High Plains than in other regions, with 16\% of the populations resistant and 22\% less sensitive. Approximately 90\% of the populations from the High Plains that exhibited resistance to atrazine POST also were resistant to atrazine PRE. Of the 160 populations tested for pyrithiobac, approximately 99\% were resistant or less sensitive, regardless of the region. No resistance was found to fomesafen, tembotrione, or dicamba. However, 22\% of the populations from the High Plains were less sensitive to 1X (93 g ai ha−1) tembotrione, but were killed at 2X, illustrating the background variability in sensitivity to this herbicide. For dicamba, three populations, all from the High Plains, exhibited less sensitivity at the 1X rate (controlled at the 2X rate; 1X = 560 g ae ha−1). One population exhibited multiple resistance to three herbicides with distinct sites of action (SOAs) involving acetolactate synthase, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase, and photosystem II inhibitors. Palmer amaranth populations exhibited less sensitivity to approximately 15 combinations of herbicides involving up to five SOAs. Dose-response assays conducted on the populations most resistant to glyphosate, pyrithiobac, or atrazine indicated they were 30-, 32-, or 49-fold or more resistant to these herbicides, respectively, compared with a susceptible standard.},

Following after-ripening in winter, seeds experienced a reduction in dormancy and germinated higher at 25 to 35 C mean compared with 10 to 15 C mean. With after-ripening for an additional 3 mo in May, seeds experienced a broadening of thermal range (10 to 40 C mean), and germination in natural light or R light was more than twice the germination in the absence of light. Fluctuating temperatures (7.5 C amplitude) improved germination over constant temperatures, except in summer and fall (9 and 12 mo after seed maturation). Exposure of seeds to high temperatures during summer caused secondary dormancy induction. Averaged over thermal amplitudes, seeds retrieved in fall required mean temperatures {$>$} 25 C for increased germination. Burial in spring for 3 to 6 mo induced seed dormancy, and the relative germination in fall (12 mo after seed maturation) was at least 50\% higher for seeds retrieved from soil surface compared to seeds exhumed from 10-cm soil depth. Seeds retrieved in late summer and fall required natural light or R light for promoting germination, whereas far-red (FR) light or darkness inhibited germination. Furthermore, the effect of R and FR light was reversible, indicating a partially phytochrome-mediated germination response of Palmer amaranth seeds following 9 to 12 mo of after-ripening in the field.},

  abstract = {Core Ideas CLIMEX model projections match known Palmer amaranth distribution. Sub-Sahara Africa and Australia are at risk for Palmer amaranth establishment. Future climate scenarios indicate the potential for poleward range expansion. Herbicide-resistant weeds are increasingly becoming a major challenge for agricultural production worldwide. Palmer amaranth [Amaranthus palmeri (S.) Wats.] is an invasive annual forb that has recently emerged as one of the most widespread and severe agronomic weeds in the United States, due in part to its facility for evolving herbicide resistance. It has invaded several parts of the world, including key agricultural production regions in South America. Climate change will likely exacerbate the challenges of managing this species. To assess this, we developed a process-oriented bioclimatic niche model of Palmer amaranth to examine its potential global distribution under current conditions and future climate scenarios. The model agreed well with all credible current distribution data. Projected future increases in temperatures will expand potential Palmer amaranth range northward into portions of Canada and Europe. Model projections under current and future climates highlight several agricultural production regions of increasing and emerging risk from this weed.},

  abstract = {The failure of PRE and POST applications of atrazine to control Palmer amaranth in recent field studies prompted further investigation to determine whether this population had evolved resistance to multiple herbicide sites of action, including glyphosate (Group 9), thifensulfuron (Group 2), and atrazine (Group 5). Greenhouse and laboratory experiments were conducted to: (1) confirm the presence of resistance to glyphosate, an ALS inhibitor (thifensulfuron), and atrazine in a single Palmer amaranth population; and (2) establish the molecular basis for resistance to these herbicide sites of action. In the greenhouse, glyphosate+thifensulfuron+atrazine at 1.26 kg ae ha−1+0.0044 kg ai ha−1+1.12 kg ai ha−1 provided 55\% control of the suspected multiply resistant (MR) Palmer amaranth population and 93\% control of the known susceptible population (S). The decreased sensitivity of the MR population compared with the S population at labeled use rates of these herbicides indicated that this population was likely resistant to three different herbicide site of action groups. The RF values for POST applications of glyphosate, thifensulfuron, and atrazine were 12.2, 42.9, and 9.3 times, respectively, for the MR Palmer amaranth population relative to the S population. The RF value for atrazine PRE for the MR population was 112.2 times. Laboratory experiments confirmed that the mechanisms for resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides and glyphosate in the MR Palmer amaranth population were target-site based, via amino acid substitution and amplified EPSPS copy number, respectively. There was a Pro to Leu substitution at site 197 in the ALS inhibitor–resistant plants, and there was a greater than 50-fold increase in EPSPS copy number in the glyphosate-resistant plants. There were no nucleotide changes in the psbA gene; therefore, atrazine resistance in this population was not target-site mediated. The evolution of this multiple herbicide-resistant Palmer amaranth population poses significant management challenges to Michigan farmers.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the response of Palmer amaranth gender to nutrient deficiency and light stress. Differential gender responses were observed for all the growth, phenology, and photochemistry parameters measured. Female plants, for example, invested more in height, stem, and total dry weight, whereas male plants invested more in leaf area and leaf dry weight. The growth rate of females was higher than that of male Palmer amaranth plants, although both followed similar declining trends as the experimental period progressed. Initiation of flowering of female plants occurred 6 to 8 d earlier compared with male plants. Nitrogen and to a certain extent phosphorous were the most influential nutrients that affected measured parameters in both Palmer amaranth genders, particularly under high light intensity. Electron transport rate and chlorophyll content of female Palmer amaranth plants compared with male plants was lower at high light intensity in combination with nitrogen and phosphorous deficiencies. There is a potential to manipulate Palmer amaranth population structure by altering microenvironments at the field level.},

Palmer amaranth populations in Brazil were very difficult to control using glyphosate, which resulted in many changes to standard weed management practices. A genotyping assay was used to confirm that the population detected in Mato Grosso State, Brazil, was correctly identified as Palmer amaranth and that it was not tall waterhemp. Greenhouse dose–response curves and shikimate accumulation assays showed that the Brazilian population was highly resistant to glyphosate, with an LD50 value (3,982 g glyphosate ha−1) more than twice the typical use rates and very little shikimate accumulation at 1 mM glyphosate concentrations in a leaf-disk assay. The Brazilian population was also resistant to sulfonylurea and imidazolinone acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitor herbicides. The resistance mechanisms in the Brazilian population were identified as increased EPSPS gene copy number for glyphosate resistance (between 50- and 179-fold relative EPSPS gene copy number increase) and two different alleles for target-site mutations in the ALS gene (W574L and S653N). These results confirm the introduction of Palmer amaranth to Brazil using a genetic marker for species identification, as well as resistance to glyphosate and ALS inhibitors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Herbicide-resistant weeds are a serious problem worldwide. Recently, two populations of Amaranthus palmeri with suspected cross-resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicides (R1 and R2) were found by farmers in two locations in Argentina (Vicuña Mackenna and Totoras, respectively). We conducted studies to confirm and elucidate the mechanism of resistance. RESULTS We performed in vivo dose–response assays, and confirmed that both populations had strong resistance to chlorimuron-ethyl, diclosulam and imazethapyr when compared with a susceptible population (S). In vitro ALS activity inhibition tests only indicated considerable resistance to imazethapyr and chlorimuron-ethyl, indicating that other non-target mechanisms could be involved in diclosulam resistance. Subsequently, molecular analysis of als nucleotide sequences revealed three single base-pair mutations producing substitutions in amino acids previously associated with resistance to ALS inhibitors, A122, W574, and S653. CONCLUSION This is the first report of als resistance alleles in A. palmeri in Argentina. The data support the involvement of a target-site mechanism of resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Amaranthus palmeri populations can evolve life-history traits despite its high levels of genetic diversity and gene flow. However, it was not known whether those differences were due to selection or other evolutionary processes. We used microsatellite markers to quantify genetic differentiation among 10 Amaranthus palmeri populations and determined whether the differences in life-history traits among the populations could be attributed to selection. Genetic differentiation was small (ΦST = 0.093), indicating that there were high rates of gene flow among populations. AMOVA showed that only 9\% of the genetic variability was explained by variation among populations and 90\% was found within populations. Using ΦST as a surrogate for FST in the QST−FST analysis, we confirmed that most traits followed the same pattern as neutral markers and were not under selection. However, important traits for weediness such as plant height, dry weight and nitrogen use efficiency were under selection. These results provide evidence that selection forces in agroecosystems can increase weediness in A. palmeri, and that those forces should be identified to develop strategies to counter them when possible.},

The variation originating from such maternal effects has rarely been incorporated into models of seed germination. Here, using Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson), we examined the effects of water stress during the growth of parental plants on the progeny seed characteristics, including weight, size, final germination, and parameters of a hydrotime germination model. We grew two populations (from California and Kansas) under continuous water-deficit or well-watered conditions. In both A. palmeri populations, progeny seeds originating from water-stressed plants were heavier and larger than those from well-watered plants. Plants exposed to water stress also produced seeds that were \textasciitilde 30\% less dormant than seeds from control plants. To test whether the maternal environment affects the parameters of a hydrotime model, progeny seeds were subject to five water potentials (0, −0.2, −0.4, −0.6, and −0.8 MPa) and incubated at 20 and 30 C; germination was monitored daily. The estimated median base water potential (Ψb(50)), that is, the water potential at which 50\% of seeds cannot germinate, was consistently lower for seeds from water-stressed plants than for seeds from well-watered plants. Our results showed that A. palmeri plants experiencing drought during their growth produce seeds that are less dormant and can germinate from drier conditions—a maternal response that seems to be adaptive. These findings also call for development of germination models that incorporate the environmental conditions of both the current and past seasons to better describe the variability in germination of weed seeds.},

Experiments were conducted on these three populations to evaluate the resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides, to determine the main resistance mechanisms involved and assess the efficacy of alternative herbicides with different sites of action than ALS. The three populations were confirmed cross-resistant to ALS-inhibiting herbicides (thifensulfuron-methyl and imazamox). Gene sequencing identified a Trp to Leu substitution at position 574 of ALS gene in resistant plants, proving that the main resistance mechanism for the three populations is target-site related. The presence of other resistance mechanisms cannot be excluded. Metobromuron, metribuzin and glyphosate are still effective on these populations.},

The objectives of this study were to 1) confirm and 2) validate glyphosate and PPO-inhibitor (fomesafen and lactofen) resistance in 51 Palmer amaranth accessions from southwestern Nebraska using genotypic and whole-plant phenotypic assay correlations and cluster analysis, and 3) determine which agronomic practices might be influencing glyphosate resistance in Palmer amaranth accessions in that location. Based on genotypic assay, 88\% of 51 accessions contained at least one individual with amplification ({$>$}2 copies) of the 5-enolypyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene, which confers glyphosate resistance; and/or a mutation in the PPX2 gene, either ΔG210 or R128G, which endows PPO-inhibitor resistance in Palmer amaranth. Cluster analysis and high correlation (0.83) between genotypic and phenotypic assays demonstrated that EPSPS gene amplification is the main glyphosate resistance mechanism in Palmer amaranth accessions from southwestern Nebraska. In contrast, there was poor association between genotypic and phenotypic responses for PPO-inhibitor resistance, which was attributed to segregation for PPO-inhibitor resistance within these accessions and/or the methodology that was adopted herein. Genotypic assays can expedite the process of confirming known glyphosate and PPO-inhibitor resistance mechanisms in Palmer amaranth from southwestern Nebraska and other locations. Phenotypic assays are also a robust method for confirming glyphosate resistance but not necessarily PPO-inhibitor resistance in Palmer amaranth. Moreover, random forest analysis of glyphosate resistance in Palmer amaranth indicated that EPSPS gene amplification, county, and current and previous crops are the main factors influencing glyphosate resistance within that geographic area. Most glyphosate-susceptible Palmer amaranth accessions were found in a few counties in areas with high crop diversity. Results presented here confirm the spread of glyphosate resistance and PPO-inhibitor resistance in Palmer amaranth accessions from southwestern Nebraska and demonstrate that less diverse cropping systems are an important driver of herbicide resistance evolution in Palmer amaranth.},

  abstract = {Conservation tillage reduces the physical movement of soil to the minimum required for crop establishment and production. When consistently practiced as a soil and crop management system, it greatly reduces soil erosion and is recognized for the potential to improve soil quality and water conservation and plant available water. Adoption of conservation tillage increased dramatically with the advent of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant crops that permitted in-season, over-the-top use of glyphosate (N-[phosphonomethyl] glycine), a broad-spectrum herbicide with very low mammalian toxicity and minimal potential for off-site movement in soil or water. Glyphosate-resistant crops are currently grown on approximately 70 million ha (173 million ac) worldwide. The United States has the most hectares (45 million ha [99 million ac]) of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant cultivars and the greatest number of hectares (46 million ha [114 million ac]) in conservation tillage. The practice of conservation tillage is now threatened by the emergence and rapid spread of glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri [S.] Wats.), one of several amaranths commonly called pigweeds. First identified in Georgia, it now has been reported in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Another closely related dioecious amaranth, or pigweed, common waterhemp (Amaranthus rudis Sauer), has also developed resistance to glyphosate in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Missouri. Hundreds of thousands of conservation tillage hectares, some currently under USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service conservation program contracts, are at risk of being converted to higher-intensity tillage systems due to the inability to control these glyphosate-resistant Amaranthus species in conservation tillage systems using traditional technologies. The decline of conservation tillage is inevitable without the development and rapid adoption of integrated, effective weed control strategies. Traditional and alternative weed control strategies, such as the utilization of crop and herbicide rotation and integration of high residue cereal cover crops, are necessary in order to sustain conservation tillage practices.},

The extension package drc for the statistical environment R provides a flexible and versatile infrastructure for dose-response analyses in general. The present version of the package, reflecting extensions and modifications over the last decade, provides a user-friendly interface to specify the model assumptions about the dose-response relationship and comes with a number of extractors for summarizing fitted models and carrying out inference on derived parameters. The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art dose-response analysis, both in terms of general concepts that have evolved and matured over the years and by means of concrete examples.},

  abstract = {The ten dioecious species of Amaranthus, all originally pioneer plants of naturally disturbed habitats, have behaved quite differently during increasing human disturbance of their native continent, North America. Those at home in coastal marshes, beaches, and dunes have remained static while those from river floodplains and desert washes have been expanding and diversifying as weeds in artificially opened habitats. Direct historical evidence, mainly from a hundred year record of herbarium collections, permits partial reconstruction of the geographic and genetic changes. The amount of geographic advance has been very unequal even along different borders of a single species. In some cases expansion was local and completed before the present century; elsewhere migration has extended across whole states and is still active. However, unlike the common weedy monoecious amaranths, even the weediest dioecious species have remained geographically cohesive. With geographic expansion, former limited overlap between species has greatly deepened and exceptional hybridization has become common. Apparent hybrids derive from a large number of species pairs, involving not only all the dioecious but also some monoecious species. Crosses between dioecious and monoecious species run into a blind alley of sterility but crosses among dioecious species have yielded fertile off-spring, in some cases so abundantly that the taxonomic distinctness of the parent species is threatened. Hybrid populations are almost invariably concentrated in the newer, artificial habitats, perhaps because of less rigorous selection in such places. In natural habitats the older types of populations have remained relatively immune to invasion and hybridization.},

  abstract = {Potential effectiveness of harvest weed seed control (HWSC) systems depends upon seed shatter of the target weed species at crop maturity, enabling its collection and processing at crop harvest. However, seed retention likely is influenced by agroecological and environmental factors. In 2016 and 2017, we assessed seed-shatter phenology in 13 economically important broadleaf weed species in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] from crop physiological maturity to 4 wk after physiological maturity at multiple sites spread across 14 states in the southern, northern, and mid-Atlantic United States. Greater proportions of seeds were retained by weeds in southern latitudes and shatter rate increased at northern latitudes. Amaranthus spp. seed shatter was low (0\% to 2\%), whereas shatter varied widely in common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) (2\% to 90\%) over the weeks following soybean physiological maturity. Overall, the broadleaf species studied shattered less than 10\% of their seeds by soybean harvest. Our results suggest that some of the broadleaf species with greater seed retention rates in the weeks following soybean physiological maturity may be good candidates for HWSC.},

  abstract = {In little over 20 yr, Palmer amaranth has risen from relative obscurity to its current status as one of the most widespread, troublesome, and economically damaging agronomic weeds in the southeastern U.S. Numerous factors have enabled Palmer amaranth to become such a dominant and difficult-to-control weed, including its rapid growth rate, high fecundity, genetic diversity, ability to tolerate adverse conditions, and its facility for evolving herbicide resistance. It is both a serious threat to several U.S. cropping systems and a fascinating model weed. In this paper, we review the growing body of literature on Palmer amaranth to summarize the current state of knowledge on the biology, agricultural impacts, and management of this weed, and we suggest future directions for research.          ,              En poco más de 20 años, Amaranthus palmeri ha salido de una relativa oscuridad a su estado actual como una de las malezas agrícolas más ampliamente distribuida, más problemática y económicamente dañina en el sureste de los Estados Unidos. Numerosos factores le han permitido a A. palmeri convertirse en una maleza tan dominante y difícil de controlar, incluyendo su rápida tasa de crecimiento, alta fecundidad, diversidad genética, habilidad para tolerar condiciones adversas, y su facilidad para evolucionar resistencia a herbicidas.

  abstract = {Palmer amaranth–a fast-growing, challenging to control noxious weed that significantly reduces crop yields—was first found in Minnesota in September 2016 in conservation plantings sown with Palmer amaranth contaminated seed mixes. Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) designated Palmer amaranth as a Prohibited Noxious Weed in 2015 and listed it as a Noxious Weed Seed in 2016 by emergency order. A genetic test to identify Palmer amaranth was simultaneously developed by multiple labs providing a tool to limit its spread as a contaminant in seed. Seed companies adopted genetic testing methods for labeling seed for sale reducing introductions via the seed pathway. Additionally, MDA determined that manure spread on crop fields from contaminated screenings fed to livestock resulted in new infestations. Limiting spread via these and other potential pathways was critical to successfully reducing the impact of Palmer amaranth. MDA, University of Minnesota (UMN) Extension, Conservation Corps Minnesota and Iowa (CCMI), farmers, and other partners are working to eradicate these infestations before they can spread. In 2016, 35 sites were sown with Palmer amaranth contaminated seed mixes. Palmer amaranth was found at eight (23\%) of these sites. Management with intensive scouting, torching, prescribed burning, and herbicide application was implemented in 2016 and 2017. By 2018, no Palmer amaranth was found at any of these sites. Similar success to newer infestations in 2018, 2019, and 2020 was achieved using the same methods. MDA recorded management activities and documented a comprehensive timeline of Palmer amaranth in Minnesota. This timeline provides a story of success and challenges in combating and eradicating Palmer amaranth.},
